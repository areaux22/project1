Color Identifier Model

This model is used to identify the color of yarn that is shown, and then give suggestions on what to make based on the color available.


## The Algorithm
The algorithim is used by detecting a color in an image, based on the training it went through. It identifies a color, and then uses 'if' statements to give a suggestion based on the color it detected.
